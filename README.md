# Stock-Trading-Emulation-System-STES-for-High-School-Students
My A-level Computer Science project, a stock trading simulator designed for high school students. It fetches data of over 8000 U.S. equities from the IEX Trading API, features real-time updated interactive graphs and a ERD design with 10 linked tables.

This project was coded in C# in my second year of the A-Level Computer Science course in 2019 after being exposed to the language in school for a year.
The project was required to be submitted in 6 months time.
The idea of this project stemed from my interest in learning more about algorithemic trading as well as studying A-Level Business back then. 

The program is designed for a fictional A-level Business teacher in the U.K., the aim is to create a system where students can earn a taste of the powerfulness of algorithmic trading by providing them a platform where it can simulates real trading to a limited degree.

This project served as an experience for me to learn about fetching data from an API, transporting said data in JSON before processing them into the program and database.
I also learned about database using a custom dbConnector to execute SQL commands and MS Access to create a database with an ERD design of 10 linked tables.
The interactive charts was coded using the LiveChart package from the C# library.

A detailed documentation about the project which includes the project charter, design, test plan and evaluation can be found in the repository. 
YouTube links to the footages of the program can also be found under the document's section for 'Test plan' as only two of the forms' source code will be uploaded.

form2d shows how I have used differnt SQL commands to upate the database.

form4 uses merge sort to present the data in ASC/DSC order based on the stats that the user have chosen.
